Cohort#2 - NewForce Coding Academy Capstone Project ( https://newforce.co )

A hotel reservation system is a crucial tool in making sure guests have an easy and convenient booking process. Users can log in, view details (including photos) of each outer space-themed room, and make a reservation. The app is built with C#/.NET Core that utilizes MVC pattern combined with Entity Framework and SQL database.
